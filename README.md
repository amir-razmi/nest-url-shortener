# URL Shortener

A production‚Äëready URL shortening backend built with **NestJS**, **Prisma**, **MongoDB**, **Redis**, and **JWT**.  
Features secure user authentication, email verification, short URL creation/deletion, and visit analytics.  
This project is part of my portfolio as a **Node.js Backend Developer**, showcasing API security, database integration, caching, and Docker deployment skills.


## üöÄ Features

- **User Authentication & Email Verification**
  - Register with email and password.
  - Receive an email link for verification before you can create URLs.
  - Secure login with JWT authentication.

- **URL Management**
  - Authenticated users can create and delete their short URLs.

- **URL Redirection & Analytics**
  - Redirects visitors to the original URL.
  - Logs analytics data into MongoDB:
    - IP address
    - Browser name
    - Operating system
    - Referrer
    - User agent
    - Device type
    - Visit timestamp

- **Role-Based Access Control**
  - **User Role** ‚Äì Create and delete own short URLs.
  - **Admin Role** ‚Äì All user abilities plus access to:
    - Get all users (`GET /admin/users`)
    - Get all short URLs (`GET /admin/urls`)
    - Get overall statistics (`GET /admin/stats`)

- **API Documentation**
  - Swagger UI available at [`/api-doc`](http://localhost:5000/api-doc)

- **Dockerized Deployment**
  - Multi‚Äëservice `docker-compose` setup:
    - NestJS application
    - 3‚Äënode MongoDB replica set
    - Redis service

## üõ† Technologies Used

- [NestJS](https://nestjs.com/)
- [Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/)
- [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.com/)
- [Redis](https://redis.io/)
- [JWT](https://jwt.io/)
- [Swagger](https://swagger.io/)
- [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) & [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/)


## üì¶ Prerequisites

- Node.js v16 or higher  
- npm, yarn, or pnpm  
- Docker & Docker Compose (for containerized setup)  
- MongoDB & Redis (if running locally without Docker)  
- Email service provider credentials (SMTP) for verification emails

## ‚öôÔ∏è Installation and Setup

### üíª Local Development

1. Clone the repository:
  ```bash 
git clone https://github.com/amir-razmi/nest-url-shortener.git
cd nest-url-shortener
  ```


2. Install dependencies:
  ```bash
pnpm i
  ```


3. Copy the example environment file and configure it:
```bash
cp .example-dev.env .env
```
   Edit `.env` with your settings (e.g., MongoDB URI, Redis config, JWT secret, email service details).

4. Start local services (MongoDB and Redis) if not using Docker. Ensure they are running.

5. Run database migrations (if applicable) or seed data using Prisma:

```bash
npx prisma generate
npx prisma db push
```

6. Start the application:
```bash
pnpm start:dev
```

   The server will run on `http://localhost:5000` (or your configured port).

### üê≥  Docker Setup

1. Copy the example Docker environment file:
```bash
cp .example-docker.env .env
```
   Edit `.env` with necessary configurations.

3. Build and start the containers:
```bash
  docker-compose up -d --build
```
   This sets up:
   - The NestJS server service.
   - A 3-node MongoDB replica set for high availability.
   - A Redis service for caching.

   The application will be accessible at `http://localhost:5000` (or configured port).


## üìå Usage

1. **Register a User**: POST to `/auth/register` with email and password. Verify via the sent email.
2. **Login**: POST to `/auth/login` to get a JWT token.
3. **Create Short URL**: Authenticated POST to `/urls` with the original URL.
4. **Delete Short URL**: Authenticated DELETE to `/urls/:shortCode`.
5. **Redirect**: GET to `/:shortCode` to redirect and log visit stats.
6. **Admin Routes** (requires Admin role):
   - GET `/admin/users` - Get all users.
   - GET `/admin/urls` - Get all short URLs.
   - GET `/admin/stats` - Get overall statistics.
7. **API Docs**: Visit `/api-doc` for Swagger interface to explore all endpoints.

## üîë Environment Variables

- Use `.example-dev.env` as a template for local development.
- Use `.example-docker.env` as a template for Dockerized environments.
- Key variables include: DATABASE_URL, REDIS_URL, JWT_SECRET, EMAIL_SERVICE_CONFIG, etc.
